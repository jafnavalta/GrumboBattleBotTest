SHOP
The shop is where you can buy and sell items/equips using gold. The shop has 4 sections: the Standard, Rotation, Special and Equip shops. The standard shop has a small list of never changing items. They are always available and have infinite stock, meaning as long as you have the gold, you can always buy them. Items in the Rotation shop are items that don't appear in the Standard shop and also come in limited quantity. Check the stock to see how many are available for purchase. Try to buy these items before others do! The last shop is the Special shop. The Special shop is similar to the Rotation shop in that its items also have limited quantity. The main difference is that the Special shop can contain items from both the Standard and Rotation shop, and in multiple and mixed fashion. Multiple items can appear in a bundle for one purchase or an item might be discounted. The Special shop can also have items that don't appear in the Standard or Rotation shop. The Equip shop contains inventory that you can equip. Equips may also have a stock for rarer equips. The Rotation, Special and Equip shops rotate their inventories to a random selection of items every 3 hours, starting at 2 AM EST every day. The time left before the next rotation is indicated in the Rotation/Special/Equip shop displays. Buy what you want before others get to it first!
