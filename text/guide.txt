GRUMBO BATTLE BOT GUIDE

CHARACTER
Your Grumbo character. Raise your level by defeating Grumbos and your peers to rise up in the leaderboards of your server. Gold, items and more are at your disposable.
			
BATTLES
You can battle any Grumbo whose level is up to 20 levels higher than you. The experience, gold and chance of victory are based on the level difference between your current level and the Grumbo level. As the level of the Grumbo increases, experience increases, but gold and chance of victory decrease. Experience is also decreased independently based on how high your level is. The min victory chance is 5% and the max is 95%. While you get more gold the lower the level of the Grumbo, you will only get 10 gold if you fight a Grumbo who is over 20 levels lower than you. Actives take effect in battle but watch out, different kinds of Grumbos can appear with their own kind of active effects!
