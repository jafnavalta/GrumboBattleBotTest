GRUMBO BATTLE BOT GUIDE

CHARACTER
Your Grumbo character. These are the stats and what they affect:
HP: +5% battle chance boost near max HP. Chance decreases when below 45% HP, going down to -50% when at 0 HP.
POW: Power. Affects battle chance and damage. Chance is proportionate to enemy POW difference.
WIS: Wisdom. Affects battle chance and damage, but slightly less than POW. Chance is proportionate to enemy WIS difference.
SKL: Skill. Affects non-battle/challenge chance (boss phase, etc.), much more than POW and WIS. Also affects how much your damage is reduced by when you lose a phase. Chance is proportionate to enemy SKL difference.
DEF: Defense. Lowers damage taken after a battle/phase/etc. Damage taken is proportionate to the difference between enemy POW and character DEF.
RES: Resistance. RES*0.8% chance of avoiding negative enemy active effects.
SPD: Speed. Each speed point above or below 10 increases or decreases the battle/challenge wait time by 1 minute. Also affects how fast your turn comes in Raids.
LUK: Luck. % extra gold gained in battle/raids. Increases chance of getting more loot from bosses/raids.
Your character can also be affected by active effects through items, battle, etc. which affect the outcomes of battles, some being based on the stats above.

CLASS
Class change to your preferred class. The starting class is a level 1 adventurer. Each class has different stat scaling, unique actives and boost your character in different ways. Classes level up independently of your character up to that class' max class level. Each class level can give new stats or active effects, some permanent and some unique to the class. 1 class experience is gained per battle, win or lose, and classes level up at 25 class experience.
You can only class change once every 12 hours.
