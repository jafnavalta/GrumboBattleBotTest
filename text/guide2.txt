BATTLES
You can battle any Grumbo whose level is up to 20 levels higher than you. The experience, gold and chance of victory are based on the level difference between your current level and the Grumbo level. Chance of victory is further swayed based on character and Grumbo stats. As the level of the Grumbo increases, grumbo stats and experience increases, but gold and chance of victory decrease. Experience is also decreased independently based on how high your level is. The min victory chance is 5% and the max is 95%. While you get more gold the lower the level of the Grumbo, you will only get 10 gold if you fight a Grumbo who is over 20 levels lower than you. Actives take effect in battle but watch out, different kinds of Grumbos can appear with their own kind of active effects! You will take damage (lose HP) after every battle. If you win, you will lose 3 HP (before factoring in actives). If you lose, you will lose HP proporionate to the difference between the enemy POW and your DEF.
