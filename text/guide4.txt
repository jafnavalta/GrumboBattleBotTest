RAID
You can begin to raid when you meet the level requirements necessary for challenging a particular raid boss. You can start/join a raid every 8 hours if you have at least 1 battle stock. Raids are boss battles with a group of 2-4 users. All users need to meet the level requirement of the raid that you want to challenge. Raid leaders can start a raid group and other users can join that users raid group. When the leader is ready, they can begin the raid. Raids play out with each character and the boss taking their turns individually, with turns being determined by SPD and the order in which you joined the raid group. Offensive actives will activate on character turns and defensive actives will activate on boss turns. When either all raid members' HP is reduced to 0 (win) or the boss' HP is reduced to 0 (lose), the raid ends. If you win, every raid member gains gold depending on the raid and a chance at loot in the same manner as boss loot without a first time drop. However, if the average level of the raid members is 15 levels above the raid level, a user is within 15 levels of the raid level and that user's level is less than 10 below the average level of the raid members, that particular user will only gain 25% of the gold reward and their chance at loot will be reduced.
